# NFC Explorer

This is a very simple Android app to scan NFC tags/cards and extract as much information as possible from them.
The app is "read-only" and does not perform any write operations.

## Build

Launch Android Studio then select "Build APK" from the Build menu.

## Install

A signed APK is available in `./app/app-release.apk`.

## Disclaimer

This is my first Android app therefore don't use the source code as reference because I have no idea what I'm doing!
Besides, I hate Java.
However, improvement suggestions are welcomed :)
